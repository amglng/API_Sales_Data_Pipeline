# API Sales Data Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview

This mini-project demonstrates a **batch data pipeline** that fetches data from a free API, transforms it into a clean CSV format, and outputs summary statistics.

The pipeline follows the **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pattern:

1. **Extract**: Fetch data from a public API in JSON format.
2. **Transform**: Clean, validate, and flatten the data into a tabular structure.
3. **Load**: Save the clean data to a CSV file for analysis.

This project is designed as a learning exercise in **data engineering fundamentals**.
